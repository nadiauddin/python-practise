### Dictionaries allow you to connect pieces of related information
### i.e. in dictionaries with word connected to meaning

book_1 = {'author' : 'nadia uddin', 'price' : 10}

print(book_1['author'])
print(book_1['price'])

# author is the key, 'nadia uddin' is the value associated with it
# A dictionary consists of key-value pairs (like enz-subs complx)
book_1 = {'author' : 'nadia uddin', 'price' : 10}

# dict vs list: info stored in pairs rather than sequences

# question 3

# Write a program that simulates a lottery.
# The program should have a list of seven numbers that represent a lottery ticket.
# It should then generate seven random numbers.
# After comparing the two sets of numbers, the program should output a prize based on the number of matches:
# ● £20 for three matching numbers
# ● £40 for four matching numbers
# ● £100 for five matching numbers
# ● £10000 for six matching numbers
# ● £1000000 for seven matching numbers

# Own extension task: Ask the user if they would like to repeat the game

import random2

# generating 7 random numbers between 1 and 20 in ascending order
    number_range = list(range(1, 20))
    winningNumbers = random2.sample(number_range, 7)

    # while loop to ensure there are no repeated numbers in the winning lottery numbers
    while winningNumbers in number_range:
        winningNumbers = random2.sample(number_range)
        number_range.append(winningNumbers)

    # Adding user's input to a list to finally output their chosen lottery numbers
    userNumbers = []
    for i in range(0, 7):
        numbers = int(input("Please choose a number between 1 and 20: "))
        userNumbers.append(numbers)
    userNumbers.sort()

    # Printing user's chosen numbers and the winning lottery numbers
    print("Your numbers are: " + str(userNumbers))

    print("The winning numbers this week are: " + str(winningNumbers))

# question 3

# Write a program that simulates a lottery.
# The program should have a list of seven numbers that represent a lottery ticket.
# It should then generate seven random numbers.
# After comparing the two sets of numbers, the program should output a prize based on the number of matches:
# ● £20 for three matching numbers
# ● £40 for four matching numbers
# ● £100 for five matching numbers
# ● £10000 for six matching numbers
# ● £1000000 for seven matching numbers

# Own extension task: Ask the user if they would like to repeat the game

import random2

# generating 7 random numbers between 1 and 20 in ascending order
number_range = list(range(1, 20))
winningNumbers = random2.sample(number_range, 7)
winningNumbers.sort()

# while loop to ensure there are no repeated numbers in the winning lottery numbers
while winningNumbers in number_range:
    winningNumbers = random2.sample(number_range)
    number_range.append(winningNumbers)

# Adding user's input to a list to finally output their chosen lottery numbers
userNumbers = []
for i in range(0, 7):
    numbers = int(input("Please choose a number between 1 and 20: "))
    userNumbers.append(numbers)
userNumbers.sort()

# Printing user's chosen numbers and the winning lottery numbers
print("Your numbers are: " + str(userNumbers))

print("The winning numbers this week are: " + str(winningNumbers))

# Creating conditions to compare chosen numbers to winning numbers to
# check whether a prize has been won
if userNumbers == winningNumbers:
    print("CONGRATULATIONS, you have just won the lottery! You have won £1,000,000!")
else:
    print("You have not won the lottery this week.")
